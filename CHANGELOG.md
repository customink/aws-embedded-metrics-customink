See this http://keepachangelog.com link for information on how we want this documented formatted.

## v0.7.0

### Added

- A new `Tcp` sink is added. The `Tcp` sink can send EMF messages to any valid TCP endpoint.
- `tcp-client` will be required at runtime if you use the `Tcp` sink. Originally a small hand-written TCP client was used but it proved unreliable and well outside the scope of this library.
- Added the new `Units` class for easy reference to the accepted metric units.

- Moved concurrent-ruby to runtime dep.
