See this http://keepachangelog.com link for information on how we want this documented formatted.

## v0.7.0

### Added

- Two new sinks now exists, `Tcp` and `Async`. The `Tcp` sink can EMF messages to any valid TCP endpoint, and `Async` can wrap any sink to ensure your program isn't impacted by writing to the network/disk/etc.
- Included a new dependency, `tcp-client`. Originally a small hand-written TCP client was used but it proved unreliable and well outside the scope of this library.
- Added the new `Units` class for easy reference to the accepted metric units.

## v0.6.0

### Fixed

- Moved concurrent-ruby to runtime dep.

## v0.5.0

### Added

- Simple singleton/delegator for metrics instance in Rails.

### Changed

- Use Concurrent Ruby for Logger data.

## v0.3.0

### Added

## v0.2.0

### Changed

- `Lambda` sink renamed to `Stdout` to reflect its destination rather than its intended use
